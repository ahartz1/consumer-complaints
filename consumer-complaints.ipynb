    "Similar to faxes that pile up over the weekend, I would expect Monday to be a big day for mail processing. It is surprising that Tuesday is the big day here. Especially because mail rarely is an overnight affair; to arrive on Tuesday, it would need to be mailed late in the previous week (which is against the trends). There may be an office staffing issue behind this. Or, maybe people take care of their complaint while they are home for the weekend and it arrives by Tuesday."
