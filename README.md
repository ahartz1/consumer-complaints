# Analyze Consumer Complaint Data

## Description

Use pandas to read and analyze data from the [CFPB Consumer Complaint
Database](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaintdatabase/). This database is
a collection of all complaints made by American consumers to the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should understand:

* the joy and power of Pandas

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* read in CSV files using Pandas
* pull out and summarize data
* turn Pandas data frames into charts

## Details

### Deliverables

* A Git repo called consumer-complaints containing at least:
  * `README.md` file explaining how to run your project
  * a `requirements.txt` file
  * an IPython notebook and/or a Python package called consumer-complaints

### Requirements

* No PEP8 or Pyflakes warnings or errors

## Normal Mode

Use Pandas to read in the included file, `complaints_dec_2014.csv`.

Calculate and chart:

* Number of complaints by product
* Number of complaints by company (top 10 companies only)
* Number of complaints by company response
* Mean number of complaints by day of week
* Any other insights you find interesting

Write up a summary of what you found from each chart you made.

## Hard Mode

In addition to the requirements from **Normal Mode**:

* Combine the complaints data with US population by state data (find this
  yourself) and then chart the frequency of complaints by state per capita.
* Find statistically significant outliers of complaints by ZIP code. Look these
  up to see if there's a possible reason (military bases are often surrounded
  by predatory lending companies, for example.)

## Nightmare Mode

In addition to the requirements from **Hard Mode**:

* Take the frequency of complaints by state per capita and then make a chart
  of the US, with frequency of complaints matched to a scale of lighter color
  (low frequency) to darker color (high frequency), with a legend.

## Additional Resources

* [CFPB Consumer Complaint Database data and visualizations](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaintdatabase/)

## Credit

The [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/) is
pretty great! Thanks for making your data public.
